In 2022, the 26th Aerodynamic Decelerator Systems Technology Conference and Seminar will be held at DGA Techniques AÃ©ronautiques and Mercure Toulouse Centre Compans Hotel, Toulouse France.

This year we expect to hear exciting updates about the NASAâ€™s Commercial Crew program including parachute systems for Orion vehicles for Artemis I and Artemis II, and recent developments in trajectory planning and guidance methodologies for cruciform and ram-air parachutes; learn about AAIRDUCT (Autonomous Aerial Insertion and Resupply into Dense, Urban, Complex Terrain Joint Capability Technology Demonstration) and SOAR (Squad Operations Advanced Resupply) and other programs. We will continue discussing thought-provoking wind tunnel and drop test data, as well as innovations in instrumentation and materials. As usual, we expect to have a stimulating student paper competition.

Join us in Toulouse for the opportunity to interact with researchers, system developers, product support personnel, managers, and business developers from throughout industry, government, and academia.
